# 🚀 Neural Network from Scratch with Python and NumPy

Welcome to my **Neural Network from Scratch** project! 🎉 This repository contains a fully functional implementation of a neural network trained on the **Fashion MNIST dataset** using **only Python and NumPy**—no machine learning libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch were used. 🧠✨

---

## 🔍 Overview

This project aims to demystify the inner workings of neural networks by implementing every step from scratch, including:
- **Data preprocessing**
- **Forward propagation**
- **Backpropagation**
- **Weight updates**

### Key Features
- Supports multi-layer neural networks.
- Implements **ReLU activation**, **softmax function**, and **cross-entropy loss**.
- Trained using **stochastic gradient descent (SGD)**.
- Achieved **85% test accuracy** after 25 epochs.

## 📊 Dataset

The project uses the Fashion MNIST dataset, a collection of grayscale images of 28x28 pixels, representing 10 clothing categories:

| Label | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 0     | T-shirt/top |
| 1     | Trouser     |
| 2     | Pullover    |
| 3     | Dress       |
| 4     | Coat        |
| 5     | Sandal      |
| 6     | Shirt       |
| 7     | Sneaker     |
| 8     | Bag         |
| 9     | Ankle boot  |

### Download Dataset

The dataset is not included in the repository. To download the dataset, run the `download_dataset` script.

The dataset can be downloaded manually or through Python using `urllib`. Refer to the script for automated downloading and extraction.

## 🛠️ How to Run

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- NumPy library

### Steps

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/vignesh19032005/neural-network-from-scratch.git
    cd neural-network-from-scratch
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install numpy
    ```

## Getting Started

Before running the neural network code, you need to download the MNIST dataset. Run the following command:

```sh
python download_dataset.py
```

This will download and extract the dataset files required for training and testing the neural network.

3. Run the script:
    ```bash
    python neural_network.py
    ```

## 📈 Results

After training the neural network for 25 epochs:

- Training Loss: 0.3855
- Test Accuracy: 85.09%

### Example Output:

```yaml
Epoch 1/25, Loss: 0.9147
Epoch 2/25, Loss: 0.7218
...
Epoch 25/25, Loss: 0.3855
Test Accuracy: 0.8509
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

Here are some potential improvements for the model:

- Add Regularization: Implement dropout or L2 regularization to prevent overfitting.
- Experiment with Optimizers: Try using Adam or RMSProp for faster convergence.
- Increase Layers: Add more hidden layers to explore deeper architectures.
- Learning Rate Tuning: Experiment with adaptive learning rates.
