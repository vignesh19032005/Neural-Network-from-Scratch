🚀 Neural Network from Scratch with Python and NumPy
Welcome to my Neural Network from Scratch project! 🎉 This repository contains a fully functional implementation of a neural network trained on the Fashion MNIST dataset using only Python and NumPy—no machine learning libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch were used. 🧠✨

🔍 Overview
This project aims to demystify the inner workings of neural networks by implementing every step from scratch, including:

Data preprocessing
Forward propagation
Backpropagation
Weight updates
Key Features
Supports multi-layer neural networks.
Implements ReLU activation, softmax function, and cross-entropy loss.
Trained using stochastic gradient descent (SGD).
Achieved 85% test accuracy after 25 epochs.

📊 Dataset
The project uses the Fashion MNIST dataset, a collection of grayscale images of 28x28 pixels, representing 10 clothing categories:

Label	Description
0	T-shirt/top
1	Trouser
2	Pullover
3	Dress
4	Coat
5	Sandal
6	Shirt
7	Sneaker
8	Bag
9	Ankle boot

🚀 Next Steps
Here are some potential improvements for the model:

Add Regularization: Implement dropout or L2 regularization to prevent overfitting.
Experiment with Optimizers: Try using Adam or RMSProp for faster convergence.
Increase Layers: Add more hidden layers to explore deeper architectures.
Learning Rate Tuning: Experiment with adaptive learning rates.
